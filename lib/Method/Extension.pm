Method::Extension - easily extend existing packages using method extension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Foo;
    # no baz method
    ...

    package Bar;

    use Method::Extension;

    sub baz :ExtensionMethod(Foo::baz) {
        my ($self, ... ) = @_; # $self will be a Foo instance

        return "Baz from extension method";
    }
    ...

    Foo->new->baz();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One good definition of Method Extension can be found L<here|https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb383977(v=vs.110).aspx>.

    Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type. Extension methods are a special kind of static method, but they are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. For client code written in C# and Visual Basic, there is no apparent difference between calling an extension method and the methods that are actually defined in a type.

In other words, you can create, in C# for example, one subroutine and use a syntax sugar to invoke as a method. In other words, instead do this:

    my $foo = Foo->new;
    baz( $foo );

You can do:

    $foo->baz(); # magic!

This is very useful when you deal with languages like C# or Java, when you have a very strict way for add behavior to one class (Java does not support multiple inheritance, for example). 

Of course, in Perl we have more tools. L<Moose>/L<Moo> Roles, for example, are a great way to extend one class ( and you can apply one role in runtime ).

But I miss extension methods. Because it is a syntax sugar we do not change the original class, and there is no way to emulate this in Perl (maybe override the operator -> or using some dark magic). 

The solution is ugly: this package offer one L<attribute> C<ExtensionMethod> and it allows to inject the subroutine in the specified package. It is not a B<real> extension method but it is our first effort. It is important call the attribute with the package + the method name ( I loose the subroutine name when we real with attributes ). 

What we have: one attribute who helps to inject one subroutine in another package.

What I want to do (future): one way to avoid inject the subroutine, just like the sugar:

    $object->extension_method( args... );

became

    extension_method( $object, args... );

Better:

    {
        use Bar qw(baz);

        Foo->new->baz; # ok
    }

    Foo->new->baz # method not found

If someone has some idea to help me on this, please let me know.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 ExtensionMethod

With this attribute we can insert one subroutine to one existing package.

Usage: C<ExtensionMethod(Package::method_name)>.

Example:

    package Bar;

    sub baz :ExtensionMethod(Foo::baz) {
        ...
    }

This inject the method Bar::baz into Foo::baz.

Important: you should not forget to rewrite the method name. We loose the subroutine name when we deal with attribute.

The good point is: we can use a different name. And we can inject in multiple packages too if we pass an array.
